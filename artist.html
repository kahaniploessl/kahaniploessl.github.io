      <h2> About the Artist </h2>
      <p>
        Kahani Ploessl is a generative artist passionate about exploring the bounds between digital and physical reality - the technological and the natural, the enigmatic and the computational, the immaterial and the material.
        
        <br><br>
        Kahani Ploessl is an artist of many disciplines, combining technologic skill and traditional artistry into a unique hybrid for future conceptualizations. Guided by abstract posthumanism, Kahani's practice aims to redefine technological experiences as a compatible extension to human existence. This primarily takes the form of generative sketches, creative coding, or illustrative concept art, each of which experiments with thoughtful computation and digital manifestation as a means for disrupting established structures between machines, operators, and data.
Grounding these abstract ideas into relevant projects, Kahani's prototype oriented practice pulls futuristic concepts into the present day. For example, while "de-generate" invents new forms for digital inhabitance, its gaming interface invites engagement and is immediately accessible. Furthermore, as a Technical Research Assistant on Sara Diamond's Crossing Fonds project, experimental capabilities of the digital realm are explored so as to reinvent how digital archives may be discovered, transversed, and contextualized.
